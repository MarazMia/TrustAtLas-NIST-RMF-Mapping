 Landscape of Trustworthy AI Frameworks and Metrics: Mapping to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework


[![NIST AI RMF](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-NIST%20AI%20RMF%201.0-blue)](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)


This repository provides a systematic audit and mapping of the Trustworthy AI (TAI) landscape. It canonizes **X** foundational framework papers and **Y** technical metrics, aligning them directly with the core functions and trustworthiness pillars defined in the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)**.



## 📊 Study Overview

* **Total Framework Papers Included:** X
* **Total Metrics Canonized:** Y
* **NIST Alignment:** Each metric is categorized under the 7 NIST Trustworthiness Characteristics:
    * Valid & Reliable
    * Safe
    * Secure & Resilient
    * Accountable & Transparent
    * Explainable & Interpretable
    * Privacy-Enhanced
    * Fair (with harmful bias managed)

## 📑 The Comprehensive Metric Sheet
The core of this repository is the `TAI_Metrics_Book.xlsx`. This master sheet standardizes metrics across the following technical fields to ensure consistency in AI auditing and evaluation.

### Column Field Specifications
| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Metric** | Name of the metrics. |
| **Framework** | From which frameworks the metrics is provided |
| **Model Type** | The classical type of the AI model (e.g., rule-based, machine learning, deep learning, language model). |
| **Scope** | The component of the AI system for which the metric is applicable (e.g., Dataset, Model, Environment where the model or data is conducting). |
| **Phases** | The specific action era where the metric can be applied (e.g., design and data collecting or D & D phase, model training, model testing, deployment). |
| **Datatype** | The variable type of the metric with proper value range (e.g., Float, Integer, Boolean, Descriptive, Graphical). |
| **Description** | A qualitative description of what the metric evaluates and its significance. |
| **Formula** | The formal mathematical formulation of the metric. |
